Hi! I'm putting together a portfolio of simple applications coded in Python3.The code you will read here is relatively elementary. In the portfolio, you'll find code for: a simulative dice-rolling application, a simulative randomized name-draw application and part of an event-driven application where the end user selects another end user within close proximity.
